    "### Course structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a data science course in *Python3* (hereafter referred to just *Python*) designed for participants with basic Python experience. The course will be run over **8 weeks** with the following structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monday lectures** will start with information about Python syntax, the Jupyter notebook interface, and move through concepts such as how to write functions and handle data, using the *pandas* and *numpy* packages, how to calculate summary information from a data frame, and approaches to do plotting, modelling and basics of machine learning. Each lecture will conclude with an **assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **During the week (Tuesday-Thursday)**, participants are invited to review the materials presented in the Monday lecture and complete the assignment throughout the week with the help of trainers via the Teams chat\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Friday recap** the trainers will provide a walk-through the assigment and answer any questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of the first two weeks, the trainers will introduce a **challenge** involving a dataset of interest to the participant and/or one provided by the trainers. Anyone keen to apply the weekly learnings is invited to apply them to the challenge dataset acquired throughout the course and submit their approach to the trainers in week 7. On the last session on week 8, participants taking part on the challenge are invited to present to the rest of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The course will cover concepts and strategies for working with data more effectively in Python with the aim of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing **reusable** code, using Python's **functions, modules and libraries**\n",
    "- Acquiring a working knowledge of **key concepts** which are prerequisites for advanced programming, data visualisation and modelling, and machine learning\n",
    "- Expanding knowledge of *Python* with applications to life data sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is open to any AstraZeneca colleagues with some basic knowledge of Python. We are so excited that you want to learn Python :) ! We will start with a brief recap on Python basic concepts and we will build up from there. You will set the pace and the amount of material that we will cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions, suggestions and ideas from participants are welcomed via the Teams chat, e-mail or during the lectures and recaps. Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining course materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The course materials (lectures, assignments and solutions) are accessible via GitHub: https://github.com/AstraZeneca/data-science-python-course\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d like you to follow along with the example code as we go through the course materials together, and attempt the assignment and challenge to practice what you’ve learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: the course materials will be updated throughout the course, so we recommend downloading the most recent version of the materials before each lecture or recap session. The latest notebooks and relevant materials for this course can be obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the GitHub page for the course: https://github.com/AstraZeneca/data-science-python-course\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on the green **Code** button (right, above the list of folders and files). This will cause a drop-down menu to appear\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click on the **Download ZIP** option. A zip file containing the course content will be downloaded to your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Move the zip file to wherever in your directories is preferred e.g. Home or Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Decompress the zip file to get a folder containing the course materials. Depending on your operating system, you may need to double-click the zip file, or issue a command on the terminal. On Windows 10, you can right click, click **Extract All...**, click **Extract**, and the folder will be decompressed in the same location as the zip file\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Launch Jupyter Notebook. Depending on your operating system, you may be able to search for \\\"Jupyter\\\" in the system menu and click the icon that appears, or you may need to issue a command on the terminal. On Windows, you can hit the Windows key, search for \\\"Jupyter\\\", and click the icon that appears. For more information on installing Jupyter Notebook, please continue reading the next section\n",
    "\n",
    "7. After launching, the Jupyter notebook home menu will open in your browser. Navigate to the course materials that you decompressed in step 5, and click on the lecture or recap notebook of the week to launch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a general purpose programming language that is useful for writing scripts to work effectively and reproducibly with data. It was initially created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python is widely used in data science, bioinformatics and scientific computing, both in academia and industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is available in all popular operating systems (Mac, Windows and Linux). The default Python installation comes with \"batteries included\" and the standard library (some of which we will see in this course) provides built-in support for lots of common tasks e.g. numerical & mathematical functions, interacting with files and the operating system ... There is also a wide range of external libraries for areas not covered in the standard library, such as *pandas* (the Python ANalysis DAta Library), *matplotlib* (the Python plotting library) and *biopython* which provides tools for bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter** is a nonprofit organization created to \"develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages\". Jupyter supports execution environments and has developed and supported the interactive computing products e.g. Jupyter Notebook, which we will be using during this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, interactive data visualizations and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to run Python?** Python is an interpreted language, this means that your computer does not run Python code natively, but instead we run our code using the Python interpreter. There are three ways in which you can run Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directly typing commands into the interpreter: good for experimenting with the language, and for some interactive work e.g. using the command line and/or IPython\n",
    "- Using a Jupyter Notebook: great for experimenting with the language, as well as for sharing and learning\n",
    "- Typing code into a file and then telling the interpreter to run the code from this file: good for larger scripts, and when you want to run the same code repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this course, you need to have Python3 and Jupyter installed on your computer. If you do not have these installed already, we recommend following the instructions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the AZ Software Store. The home screen should look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/az_softwarestore_1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the \"Search Catalog\" bar at the top, search for \"python\". This should return, along with many more, \"Python 3.9.7\":\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/az_softwarestore_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click the \"Install Now\" button and this should start the downloading procedure. *Note: make sure you have added the correct version of Python to your cart (\"Python 3.9.7\"), as other versions e.g. \"Anaconda 3.7\" are not supported. You should receive a mesage like this (with a different Request ID)*. If the steps above do not work, you may want to get in touch with [AZ IT](https://azprod.service-now.com/az). After the installation of Python has been completed (you will receive an email from AZSoftwareStore about the completion of your order). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Head down to the Search box (on the Start bar) and type *Command Prompt* and click on the first item showing a black screen. Once you click on it, a black screen with a white blinking cursor should appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you open the command prompt, type ```pip install notebook --user``` and let it install all the required Jupyter packages. *Note: If unexpected errors happen, try to update pip by typing ```pip install --upgrade pip --user```* and then try to run the first command again. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once all the necessary packages have been installed, you need to open Jupyter. You can do these via two different ways, note that you need to replace *$< \\text{prid} >$* with your own prid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the folder ```C:\\Users\\<prid>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python39\\Scripts\\``` and double-click on ```jupyter-notebook.exe```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type the following line on the command prompt: ```C:\\Users\\<prid>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python39\\Scripts\\jupyter-notebook.exe```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a message will appear and right after, a new tab on your internet browser will take you straight to the homepage of Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let us know via the Teams channel if you experience any issues with installations prior or during the course. We have booked a troubleshooting time before lecture 1 dedicated to resolve any installation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux and macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions **Getting started with the classic Jupyter Notebook** / **Installation with pip** as described in [here](https://jupyter.org/install). If you run intro trouble, please get in touch with Sergio Martinez Cuesta\n"
