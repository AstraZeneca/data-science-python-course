    "A function is basically a block of code that only runs when it is called. Functions are a general programming tool, and can be found in many programming languages. All functions operate in three steps:\n",

    "1. Call: the function is called with some inputs\n",
    "2. Compute: based on the inputs, the function does something\n",
    "3. Return: the function outputs the result of the computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many functions pre-loaded, for example the print function. In this example, the function is **called** with some text as the input, the **computation** is doing something to the text (keeping it the same), and the **return** is the printing of text to screen."

    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow you to wrap up a chunk of code and execute it repeatedly without having to type the same code each time. This has four main advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy: by typing the code once, you only have one chance to make a mistake or typo (and if you discover a mistake, you only have to correct it once!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility: you can change or expand the behaviour of a function by making a change in the function code, and this change will apply across your script\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readability: if someone reads your code, they only have to read the function code to understand how it works, instead of reading chunks of repeated code\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portability: you can easily copy a function from one script and paste it in another script, instead of having to extract general-purpose lines of code that are embedded in a script written for a specific purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How?\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a new function, the **def** statement is used to name the function, specify its inputs, add the computation steps, and specify its output. This results in a **function definition**, and the function can then be called later in the script. All function definitions must have three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name: you can call your function anything, but usually verbs are better than nouns (e.g. echo_text rather than text_echoer). Python will not check whether a function already exists with the name that you choose, so **do not use the same name as an existing function** e.g. print()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Input: almost all functions take at least one input, either data to perform computaton on, or an option to change how the computation proceeds. You don't have to specify an input, but you **must** add a set of brackets after the function name, whether this contains any inputs or not\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return: the return statement is required to signify the end of the function definition. You don't have to return anything at the end of the function, but the return statement must still be there\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example of a function that takes one input (the text to be printed), and returns the text to the user. We assign the results of calling the function to a new variable, and print the results. As you can see, every line that you want to include in the function definition must be indented, including the **return** statement:"

In contrast, if a variable is declared inside a function, it is a **local variable**: it can only be accessed from inside the function, but not outside.

    "4. In the data folder, you will find a file \"imagine_lyrics.txt\", which contains the lyrics to the song Imagine by John Lennon. Your task is to find out which word is used most frequently in the lyrics. There are many ways to approach this, but however you solve it, remember to break up your code into functions! Some words aren't very interesting e.g. \"the\", \"a\", \"and\" so we might want to exclude these from consideration when finding the most frequent word in a set of lyrics. Include an option to exclude a custom list of words, and test how the results change when excluding \"the\", \"a\" & \"and\"."
